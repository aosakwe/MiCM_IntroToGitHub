# Database Team Project

Undertake this project if you do not want to do the data analysis project. Instead, you will look at building a database for bioinformatics tools. Essentially, you will compile links to different tools/articles/resources that are useful for bioinformatics.
## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to practice developing a working database
as a team.You should select a team member who will host the main fork of
this repository from which the rest of the team can make changes.
Consider the following tasks:

- will you focus on a single field of bioinformatics (e.g. genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)?
- how will you organize the links into the database (themes, type of resource etc.)?
- who will gather article links?
- who will gather tools?
- who will gather resources/teaching materials?
- how will you document these links

## Appendix:

GitHub isn't just useful for storing code. You will often find repositories that are solely designed to store and document large ammounts of links and resources for a given topic. Here is an example for single cell foundation models: https://github.com/KatarinaYuan/awesome-single-cell-foundation. A database can be single file or a very complex system. Up to you to decide how to build it! 

# Example Results from Workshop Attendees

## FUNGI

A humble group of silly fungi people putting together a resource list of different databases and tools for fungal bioinformatics research

### Fungi related databases
- **FungiDB** https://fungidb.org
  - is a free online resource for data mining and functional genomics analysis for fungal and oomycete species.
 
- **The Y1000+ project** https://y1000plus.wei.wisc.edu/index.html
  - Free online collection of all yeast genomes
 
- **EnsemblFungi** https://fungi.ensembl.org
 
### Genomics tools

Phylogenomic data profiling by the Satjich lab on [GitHub](https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling)

### Aptamers
I found a nice paper on aptamers that maybe we can check and read:
