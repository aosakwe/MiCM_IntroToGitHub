# Python Team Project

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to practice developping a working codebase as a team.You should select a team member who will host the main fork of this repository from which the rest of the team can make changes. Consider the following tasks:

- who will work on the data cleaning functions?
- who will develop the plotting functions?
- who will combine the above functions into the main script?
- how will you test that the functions are working?
- who will write documentation for what the functions do?

You have the choice to work with two datasets:
- the gapminder dataset which contains data on yearly socio-economic indicators for countries
- the breast cancer dataset containing biopsy data for a range of breast cancer cases.
